# Welcome to Spotistats Support

On this website I'll post short articles to answer the most common questions and issues. You can also find various guides like [how to import your streaminghistory](/import/guide) here :)

This site is still a work in progress, so your question may not be answered by one of the pages here. If that's the case, don't worry, you can always send me an email at [sjoerd@spotistats.app](mailto:sjoerd@spotistats.app) (note that I get loads of emails every single day and I may not be able to answer you right away)
