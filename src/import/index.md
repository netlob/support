# Import your streaminghistory

Spotify provides some data through [their api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) but this does not include the amount of times you've streamed a specific artist or track

In order to gain access to these features you'll have to import your streaminghistory:

- Playcount (for artists, tracks & albums)
- Full streaminghistory (duhh)
- Order your top tracks & artists by the amount of streams [instead of machine learning](/)
- All charts which include some amount of streams
