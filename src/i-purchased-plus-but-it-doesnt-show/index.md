# I've bought Plus but my app is still in the free mode

## iOS

Apple has some issues with the App Store where it can take a couple of days before your purchase is verified. You can try to click "Restore purchases" every day and it should work sometime soon.

### It's been a week and my Plus still isn't activated

Unfortunately there's no way for me to check the status of your purchase. There's 2 things you can do:

- Try to purchase it again. Plus is a so called "non-consumable" in app purchase, which means you can only buy it once (and only get charged once). If the purchase proceeds that means that the previous purchase has failed, if this purchase fails and says "You already own this item, you'll receive it for free" that means that the previous purchase has indeed went through and you're better of trying the option below
- Contact Apple's App Store support to check the status of your purchase ([https://getsupport.apple.com](https://getsupport.apple.com))

## Android

If your you dont have Plus after purchasing it this can mean two things:

- Your payment is still pending (this happens a lot when paying with creditcard)
- The purchase failed

- Wait at least a day and click "Restore purchases". If this doesn't work you can mail me with the following details so I can check the status of the order:
  - The Google order id. You can find this in the email with your receipt and it should start with `GPA.`
  - The email adress linked to your Google Play account
  - A link to your Spotistats or Spotify profile
